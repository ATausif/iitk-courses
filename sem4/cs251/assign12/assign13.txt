Write a make file that builds a latex project.

Imagine that the top-level latex file main.tex uses two more auxiliary files
body.tex and results.tex.  The results.tex file in turn includes a tables.tex
file and some gnuplot figures.  The gnuplot figures are named graph1.pdf and
graph2.pdf.  They are built using graph1.gnu and graph2.gnu scripts which use
graph1.csv and graph2.csv respectively.  The main.tex uses a bibliography file
citations.bib.

Please write minimal staff in all these files (you may re-use from old
assignments) such that the files and the project are meaningful.

The makefile should do a minimal re-compilation.  However, it should not miss
re-building the final latex output main.pdf if any file is changed.

It must have the top-level target main.pdf.  It should also include a phony
target clean.

Write a Python script that does the following.

Given a string input, it doubles every consonant and puts an 'o' between them.
The vowels are simply left as is.

Thus, if the input is:
I am a very good student.
the output is:
I amom a voveroryoy gogoodod sostotudodenontot.

(Bonus marks: 5 for pronouncing the strings thus produced correctly. :-) )

Augment the above program to read 3 inputs (the 4th one is the string on which
it operates): the first two integers indicate the number of times a consonant
and a vowel is repeated (> 0) while the third is a vowel (check for that) that
is placed between every repetition of a consonant.

Thus, the above program is a special case with the 3 inputs being 2, 1 and 'o'.
