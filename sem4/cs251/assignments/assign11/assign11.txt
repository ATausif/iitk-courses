In your website, add another page that uses javascript.  Have two forms in it.

The first form has a single button, that when clicked, increments a variable.
The current value of the variable is displayed below the button.  This is
similar to the visitor count that you find in many webpages.

The second form inputs data in the form of three fields.  The first fields is
the name of a student.  The second area is the area, while the third is the
name of a faculty member.  Collect the data in the form of an xml.

The top level hierarchy is called interests, below which there are areas and
then faculty members and finally students.

While collecting data, if the name of an area or a faculty member is absent, it
will create the correct hierarchy.  Otherwise, it will insert appropriately.
