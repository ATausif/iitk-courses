Write a Latex document that describes the following procedure of multiplication
of two-digit numbers.

Case 1: The first digits are same, and the last ones add up to 10.

Example:
 66
x64
---
6x(6+1):6x4 = 42:24 = 4224

Case 2: The first digits add up to 10, and the last ones are same.

Example:
 34
x74
---
3x7+4:4x4 = 25:16 = 2516

Explain the procedure for mentally doing it.
Explain why this is so much easier and faster.

Also, explain algebraically why this works.

Can you generalize either or both the cases to numbers larger than two digits?

In your document, you must use the following Latex concepts:

 1. equations (using align)
 2. in-line math-mode text
 3. tables
 4. figures (draw impressive figures of examples and working using any tool you want, and import them as pdf)
 5. footnote
 6. citation (cite Atharvaveda, commentaries on Atharvaveda, with your own imagaination of other details)
 7. algorithmic* (for the pseudocode of the above procedures)
 8. bibtex (create a bib file)
 9. proper title, author and date (as due date)
10. proper sections, subsections, etc.
11. labels and their proper references
12. url (to in-line cite some website)
