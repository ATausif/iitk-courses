Movie: BROTHERS (December, 2009)
“A movie about love, loyalty, pain, duty and grief”

“I dunno who said 'only the dead have seen the end of war'. I have seen the end of war. The question is, can I live again?”

“Brothers” is a great catch on how war affects the lives of soldiers and their families. The movie showcases Tobey Maguire as Cpt. Sam Cahille and Jake Gyllenhal as Tommy, two brothers with very contrasting lives, with Sam being deployed to Iraq for war, and Tommy getting out of prison, and Natalie Portman as Sam's wife.

The film gives a horrifying, but grand insight of the horrors of a veteran, who survived and died at the same time. Sam being captured as a prisoner of war, and declared missing, we see an alluring depiction of character development as his family struggles and adapts. It is a thrilling experience to see one brother trying to get back to his family, and the other trying to turn his life around for the sake of his brother and his family.

With subtle plot development, Jim Sheridan has beautifully captured the bonds formed and those broken between contrasting characters. Although not meant for a wide range of audience, this movie is a rollercoaster ride through emotions . With the best of the cast, this is easily one of the best creations of Mr. Sheridan, and is a must watch, for it is vastly eye opening and heart wrenching.
