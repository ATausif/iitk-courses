								PROJECT PROPOSAL
					   DOMESTIC UAV PATH SYNCHRONIZATION


OVERVIEW
--------------------

	With the world constantly advancing in technology, there is now a higher
	requirement of unmanned vehicles. In the last few years, there has been an ever
	increasing interest in UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles). UAVs are controlled
	remotely or via a program.

	UAVs have a vast application set, such as items delivery, application in
	security and military, etc. However with the requirement of human serveillance
	on these machines, they are not yet trully autonomous. In order to achieve this,
	we require smart programs to control the paths of these UAVs, in a synchronized
	manner.


GOAL
--------------------

	Although there are methods to synchronize UAVs such as 'swarming' and
	'flocking', however these methods are more goal specific are not applicable to
	domestic UAVs. Our goal is to implement an app where registered/authorized
	domestic UAVs can be register which are then controlled programmatically to
	achieve a specific task it has been registered for. This will allow us extending
	the applications of UAVs to many more fields, such as agriculture and product
	delivery.


IMPLEMENTAION
--------------------

	We will create an app which will allow users to register their UAVs (licensed)
	with all the UAV specifications, such as maximum and minimum UAV speed, maximum
	and minimum height, etc. and then based on these specifications and the goal of
	the UAV, we create a path for the UAV to follow with all the time constraints
	satisfied.

	This will involve complex algorithms to minimize energy consumption and optimize
	paths. We will also need to verify the UAV state, such as necessary amount of
	battery/fuel, as well as the weather conditions prior to the flight.

	We will also require to map the area that the UAV will cover, considering all
	buildings/aerial blockages, and no-enter zones. The path we choose for the UAV
	should cover all constraints and yet optimize it sufficiently.


CHALLENGES
--------------------

	The path we decide should be flexible enough so that in case the UAV observes
	any incoming hinderance, such as birds, we should immediately change the path
	slightly. For this, the UAV must be equipped with adequate sensors to detect
	such aerial motions.

	There might unlicensed UAVs in the air during the time of the flight. This must
	be detected from the UAV itself, and if possible also be reported.


COST OVERVIEW
-------------------

	The cost of app production itself should not be high, however testing purposes
	require a heavy budget. One year requirement for the project can be overviewed
	as -
