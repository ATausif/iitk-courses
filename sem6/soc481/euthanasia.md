**Social Science Perspective**
*Aneeta A Mincoha, Arima Mishra, Vivek A Minocha*

Utilitarian Logic -
	*	extensive financial care required for the medical establishment, the
		State as well as the family
	*	does not only include the monetary funds, but the financial cost lost
		to the time spent with the ill, as well as the emotional energy spent

Aruna Shanbaug -
  * bedridden in the KEM hospital in Mumbai, for last 38 years
  * request for euthanasia rejected on the conditions
    * Aruna's medical conditions do not qualify as "brain dead", and she
    breathes on her own
    * only the KEM staff who have been the sole care givers for so long are
    entitled to the plea
  * Allowed to live, unlike Terry Schiavo, US

In India, issues of life and death are left, in addition to the doctors, in the
hands of superior forces.

Some questions -
  * When does a patient consider euthanasia? Observed in cases of losing
  complete autonomy, and even in cases where intensive care from the family is
  provided
  * Is the ill patient in an appropriate mental state to decide?
  * Who should take the decisions?
  * In case of infants, the doctors feel the parents should not have a say as
  their decision will be emotional

Important the decision to end one's life is not in a vacuum, but within the
context of social roles. Even on the death bed, a person is a social being and
is vested with social obligations and privileges towards them.

In India, processes of life and death are carried out in social contexts,
particularly religion.

With the notion of family, the decision is their and they might not opt for
euthanasia for a variety of reasons. For example, in Hindu society, there is a
huge difference in the social and ritual status, rights and privileges of a
married woman as compared to a widow.

**Moral Basis for the Right to Die**
*Sushila Rao*

Religion vs Individual - Sanctity of Life vs Right to Life

After Aruna Shanbau's case, 2011, rules allowing Passive Euthanasia under
certain conditions were laid out (following United Kingdom House of Lords)
which had otherwise been illegal since 1860, considered to be homicide

Types of Euthanasia -
  * Passive - steps taken to induce death
  * Active  - withdrawing life support to let nature take its course

Active vs Passive - Killing and Letting Die

Sanctity of Life does not just mean the life must not be ended. According to
Denan J, SOL also can mean respecting the patient's wish. Prolonging life using
Artificial means, defies the concept of SOL, and therefore Euthanasia is not
really a violation of SOL.

In case of incompetent patients, the court must respect the wishes of the
patient. He must not be treated as a second-class citizen. The approaches
available currently are
  * **substituted judgement test** - decision maker acts as a surrogate in case
  the incompetent patient cannot determine for himself
  * **best interests test** - decision maker is required to follow whatever
  course should be in the best interests of the patient (explicitly approved)

**Moral Paradox** - The SOL principle prohibits inducing death using a single
lethal injection, but only by dehydration, starvation or other slow means of
death. (Lord Brawn-Wilkinson)

**Is the 'Next Friend' the Best Friend?**
*Rakesh Shukla*

In 2011, the Shanbaug judgement appealed the Parliament to decriminilise
suicide. It held that fundamental rights such as freedom of speech also includes
freedom to not speak. Similarly, freedom of life should include the decision to
not to live. Also, the concept of suicide does not go against Religion (Lord
Ram, Mahavira, Lord Buddha achieved death by seeking it). However after Gyan
Kaur case, 1996, Supreme Court overruled that death is not be compared with
life. An act that extinguishes life is inconsistent with continued existence of
life.

There was no distinction between suicide committed out of prolonged deliberation
or impulsively. A Bill to repeal Section 309 (that crimininalised suicide) of
Indian Penal Code (IPC) was passed in 1978, but revoked in 1979. Abatement of
suicide would still be punishable under Section 306.

Minoo Misani founded the Society for Right to Die with Dignity in 1981, to
assert the right to choose to live or die.

The Court has devised the mechanism of high court benches and Court appointed
expert panel of medical experts as safeguards in cases where an appeal is made
to withdraw life support to an incompetent person, since there is a chance of
misuse, however this should not be a ground to oppose legalizing euthanasia.

The Medical Treatment of Terminally Ill Patients Bill, 2006 was passed based on
the recommendations in the report of the same name submitted by the Law
Commission under the chairmanship of M Jagannadha Rao. The report clearly
distinguished between "Euthanasia and Assisted Suicide" and "Withholding of
Life Support Systems". The report defines euthanasia as an act of any person of
intentionally killing a person who is terminally ill by inducing death.
Euthanasia and Assisted Suicide are considered unlawful, whereas withholding of
life support to terminally ill patients is looked upon as lawful, under an
informed decision.

The opinion that India is (religiously) not ready for passive Euthanasia to be
legal seems misinformed considering the number of practices of voluntary
termination of life, such as
  * Mahaprasthana
  * Santhara

The case of Aruna also contradicts the verdict passed in the Suchita Shrivastava
case, given that the decision in this case was only based on the interests of
the guardians (other nurses) without considering the interests of the patient.

There is also a utilitarian view on this, considering the commercialization of
healthcare. The hospitals tend to emotionally blackmail guardians to force the
patients to live under Life Support.
