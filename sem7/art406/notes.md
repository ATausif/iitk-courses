# ART 406 Notes

## Unity

Having unity means that a congruity exists among the elements in a design or a
composition, and they look as though they belong together, in a visual harmony
beyond that of simple intellectual connection, which merely delineates
conceptual agreement between the elements of a composition.

Visual unity must predominate over the parts, i.e. you must see the whole
pattern before you notice the individual elements.

**Gestalt Theory of Visual Psychology**: This refers to theories of visual
perception developed by German psychologists, which attempt to understand the
relation in the how a person views and image (eyes) and how he perceives it
(brain). These theories also essay at explaining how people tend to organize
design compositions as unified wholes when certain principles such as
similarity, continuation and closure are applied.

- **Similarity**
  * Similarity occurs when objects of a composition look similar
  * Any object that is dissimilar creates *emphasis*, and is an *anomaly*
  * Our brain looks for similar elements, and when we recognize them, we see a
    cohesive design, rather than an unorganized chaos.
- **Closure**
  * Closure transpires when an object is incomplete or a space is not
    completely enclosed
  * This is when a viewer's perception completes a shape

### Figure and Ground

A form, silhouette or shape is naturally seen as the *figure* while the
surrounding area is seen as the *ground*.

### Proximity

Proximity means making separate elements look together, or simply putting them
close. This is the simplest way to achieve unity in a composition.

Examples
- ***El Greco's The Vision of St.John.1608-14*** shows nude figures closely
  placed and connected via a drapery. The priest is also closely linked to the
  figures via continuation in clothes and a drapery on the ground.
- ***Paul Woner's*** painting also shows proximity by connecting independent
  elements using their shadows.

### Repetition

Examples
- ***Sophie Taeuber (Composition with Circles Shaped by Curves)*** shows unity
  by repeating circular shapes with bites cut out of them.
- ***Joe Miller (Space 47 Logo)*** show unity by repeating a single character,
  with transformation.
- ***Andy Warhol (100 Soup Cans)*** shows repetition by literally repeating 100
  soup cans as a failed attempt at art.

### Continuation

Continuation in a figure affords a viewer seamless traversing through the
elements of the composition. Continuation is a more subtle way of presenting
unity than repetition or proximity. It is, however, a standard device employed
in the graphic designs of most books, magazines and advertisements, where there
is a need of a sense of unity among the vert disparate elements these designs
are usually composed of.

This is not only an aspect for 2D designs, but can also be employed for 3D
designs.

Examples
- ***Balthus (The Living Room)*** shows a living room with distinct and varying
elements, however each and every figure is connected using continuation. The
curves of the furniture and the posture of the figures in the painting match
perfectly, thereby creating unity.

Continuity is often used along with grids, such as in newspapers and websites.

### Unity with Variety

#### The Grid

Often a checkerboard type pattern is used, which shows complete unity by
repetition of the constant shapes and the continuity of the aligned edges.
Adding variations to the gird makes the viewer thoroughly interested in the
design. An example could be ***Robert Rauschenberg's lithograph (Centennial
Certificate)*** which does not strictly follow the grid, allowing colors to
bleed through the edges, yet has the continuity afforded by a grid composition.

#### Varied Repetition

Even an obvious use of unity with variety doesn't reduce the viewer's pleasure.

Examples
- ***Kandisnsky (Several Circles)*** shows unity with variety as the circular
  shapes are repeated however have varying shapes and tones.
- ***Charley Harper (Titmouse Tidbit)*** shows obvious unity using repetition,
  however the gradually changing orientation of the bird's head shows motion and
  the varying leaves keeps the viewer engrossed in the painting.

#### Emphasis on Unity

Unifying element of repetition can be emphasized, but variety could be present
but admittedly in a subtle, understated way.

Examples
- ***British School (The Cholmondeley Sisters)*** shows unity (by repetition of
  the sisters), but with subtle variations such as different embroidery on the
  drapery of the two sisters.

#### Emphasis on Variety

Life is not always orderly and rational. Often life brings surprise, the
unexpected, and experiences that seem chaotic and hectic. To express this phase
of life, many artists have purposely chosen to underplay the unifying aspects of
their work and let the elements appear, at least superficially, uncontrolled and
free of any formal design restraints.

Although somewhat intended to be a haphazard conglomeration of incongruous
images, such compositions still preserve unity, while emphasizing on variety.
This brings about a conflict in conformity and individuality, between chaos and
control.

Examples
- ***Richard Hamilton (Just What is it that Makes Today's Home so Different, so
  Appealing)*** presents an example of the principle of emphasis on variety.

## Emphasis

### Methods of Employing Emphasis

There are multiple types of emphasis
- **Emphasis by Contrast**
  * ***George Stubbs (Zebra)*** shows a zebra with subtly enhanced contrast
    between the zebra's body and the trees and bushes behind, which are mostly
    soft-edged and muted
- **Emphasis by Isolation**
  * ***Thomas Eakins (The Agnew Clinic)*** All the doctors are well contrasted
    with the dark background and have similar tones, however the figure on the
    left is isolated from the others, and seems to be presented as a person of
    high import. Another point to note is that the gaze of this figure is
    towards the main area of operation contrasting this focal point and
    therefore giving the figure accents.
  * ***Edger Degas (Dancers Practicing at the Bar)*** puts emphasis on the small
    water can using Isolation.
- **Emphasis By Placement**
  * If many elements point to one item, our attention is directed there, and an
    emphasis point is created. Placing elements in the center of the composition
    could seem contrived and even a sign of naivete. Therefore it is interesting
    to see how the center can be used in a subtle way to create emphasis.
  * ***Susan Moore (portrait of her daughter)*** creates a emphasis point on her
    daughter's face by avoiding a frontal shot and placing her face at the
    middle axis but not at the dead center.
  * ***Jan Vermeer (The Music Lesson)*** creates an emphasis point near the
    center, and the perspective lines of the interior converges to this point,
    directing the viewer's eyes back to the figure. However, there are
    obstructions which make the composition subtly employ radial emphasis.

### Degree of Emphasis

There can be more than one focal point, however, mostly secondary focal points
have lesser attention value than the focal point and are called *accents*.
However, the artist must be careful as multiple focal points with tantamount
degree of emphasis might result in confusion rather than interesting the viewer.

#### Single Element

If a specific theme calls for a dominant, even visually overwhelming focal
point, such as in the graphic design of newspaper advertisements, billboards,
etc., we might need a single element with a high degree of emphasis.

Examples
- ***Pablo Picasso (Harlequin)*** has a single united figure loosely depicting
  Harlequin, with a heavy contrast with the background, and therefore creating
  heavy emphasis on the single element.

#### Unity with a Focal Point

Even in the presence of a strong and obvious focal point, the artist needs to
make sure that there is unity in the composition. In fact, unity is more
important than the presence of a focal point.

Example
- ***Maurice Vellekoop (Christian Dior Boutique, Valentino)*** has a strong
  focal point, created using emphasis by contrast, bright yellow dress
  accentuated by a muted blue background, however still preserves unity by using
  continuation, such as parallelism in postures and the curving shapes are
  balanced by other similar curves.

### Rule of Thirds: The Golden Mean

The points of intersections created by horizontal and vertical lines dividing
a picture into three parts each are termed as the power points. Any element
placed over these points are bound the grab the attention of the viewer.

## Scale and Proportion

*Scale* refers to size of the elements of a design compared to real life, whereas
*proportion* refers the relative size of the elements.

### Hieratic Scaling

In past centuries, visual scale was often related to thematic importance, and
the size of the figures based on their symbolic importance in the subject being
presented. This use of scale is called *hieratic scaling*.

Example
- ***Fra Filippo (Saint Lawrence)*** exerts the use of hieratic scaling, making
  the scale of Saint Lawrence much larger than the other saints, thereby giving
  him emphasis.

### Monumentality

Monumentalism refers to recreation of simple unappreciated objects or beings at
a large scale (1/2 scale painting of a human is monumental). Monumental scale
could be employed to depict power, or simple purveyance of the appreciation of
mundane, but extremely useful things.

Examples
- ***Michelangelo (David)***
- ***Claes Oldenburg (Typewriter Eraser)***
- ***Robert Indiana (Love)***

### Internal References

Scale of artworks can provide meaning, context, and often a clue to how it is
made or how we are meant to interpret the image or object. Humans often view an
artwork's scale as a reference to their own size.

As one identifies the scale of an artwork, one also tries to identify the
elements behind the composition, such size of the brush the artist was using,
the length of the artist's arms, etc. Choice of scale is a major factor in
achieving each artist's intention.

### Contrast of Scale

An artist may use an exaggerated scale to grab our attention, or the antithesis,
use of tiny figures in a vast space to show emotions such as anxiety.

Often large and small scale are used together in a composition, usually for a
dramatic contrast.

### Surrealism

Surrealism is based on paradox, with deliberate changing of natural scale to
intrigue and mystify the viewers. Surrealist artwork creates enigmatic images
that are not rationally explicable, that challenge the viewers with a confusion
of scale.

Examples
- ***Rene Magritte (Personal Values)*** showing objects such as a comb, glass to
  a monumental scale fitted seemingly in a bedroom.

## Space

**Visual Literacy** is the ability to recognize and understand ideas conveyed
through visible actions or images.

The process of seeing a visual is less spontaneous than we tend to believe. The
large part of seeing depends on habit and convention.

The contemporary artist is concious of both the two-dimensional plane and the
various ways to suggest three-dimensionality.

With the use of perspective lines, our visual literacy allows us to render a
two-dimensional image as a three-dimensional image, creating an illusion of
space.

Examples
- ***George Tooker (Government Bureau)*** uses the standard devices to show the
  illusion of depth in the pictorial plane. The figures in the composition
  pierce the picture plane to show us their relative positions.

In the past, artists used differential scaling for thematic importance (hieratic
  scaling) rather than employing it for alluding depth.

### Scale and Proportion

A larger proportion for an element is the easiest technique to show scale. This
even works for abstract items, but is usually only perceptible if the same shape
is repeated in smaller sizes to show depth.

Another useful technique is exaggerated scale, that is increasing the size
differences between different elements. Visual perception often helps in this
case, such as if a fish is drawn larger than a man, the human mind can only
imagine it to be closer than the man.

Examples
- ***Andro Hiroshige (Suido Bridge and Surugadai)*** employs the technique of
  exaggerated scale, where is becomes blatant to the viewer that the fish kite
  drawn with a much higher scale than the background is closer to the eye and
  the other elements are at a much larger distance.

### Overlapping

Another useful tool to show the illusion of space is overlapping. Overlapping
can be used with or without different scales. Nonetheless, overlapping
establishes an order in which the objects are kept, therefore creating the
illusion of depth.

Examples
- ***David Hockney (Mr and Mrs Clark and Percy)*** uses the concept of
  overlapping to show the order of elements, such as the table overlaps with the
  dress, showing that the position of table is closer to the hypothetical eye in
  the pictorial space.
- ***James McNeill Whistler (Whistler's Mother)*** also uses this concept.

### Vertical Location

The higher an object, the further back it is assumed to be.

Example
- ***Tom Wesselman (Still Life)*** shows objects arranged on a table, and the
  order of the objects in the 3rd axis simply rely on their vertical position.

### Aerial Perspective

This describes the use of color, mainly value (light or dark) to show depth.
The contrast is graduated ans as we move towards the background, i.e. away from
the viewer, the contrast between distinct elements lessens, and contours become
less perceptible. Using this, the far away objects seem hazy, and out of focus.

Moreover, the spatial recession is endorsed by the reduction in scale of the
elements as we move farther from the point of vision.

Example
- ***Mary Cassatt (The Fitting)*** employs the technique of Aerial Perspective
 in her painting of a landscape, with the receding contrast between trees and a
 light hazy background of a sky. This perfectly depicts how we see nature, and
 therefore a perfect parading of the illusion of depth.

Aerial Perspective, although common, is however not limited to only landscapes,
and can be used with human figures as well.

### Linear Perspective

When we see two parallel lines from a single point of vision, they appear to
converge to a point as they recede. This simple phenomenon is used to create
spatially complex systems presenting the illusion of depth. This is called
linear perspective, where all parallel lines seem to converge to a vanishing
point. Artworks created using such systems can create a great sense of depth
with due perfection,

Examples
- ***Jan Vermeer (The Music Lesson)***
- ***George Tooker (Government Bureau)***

Types of perspectives
- **One Point Perspective**: All lines converge at a single point
- **Two Point Perspective**: All lines converge at one of two points, such as
  looking at the edge of a building
- **Multi Point Perspective**: Multiple points of convergence at present. This
  can highlight looking at a space with different, but consistent angles.

**Plane/Diagonal Recession**
Diagonal recession can create more drama in the visual space. It gives a more
natural feeling to the artwork. In diagonal recession, the edges seem to recede
to a point at the eye level of the viewer, but the vanishing point is not head
on.

### Amplified Perspective

In order to involve dynamism in their artworks, some artworks introduce
Amplified Perspective in their visuals. The viewer feels as if he is being
pulled into the visual space, the effect created mostly by foreshortening and
introducing a different point of perspective, such as a photograph of a building
clicked from directly beneath. i.e. at the base of the building. The effect
would feel as if the building is stretching towards the sky, pulling the view
towards itself.

Example
- ***Uncle Sam's Pointing Finger (I want you)*** uses amplified perspective.

Amplified perspective can also artificially bring about the feeling of
monumentality.

### Multiple Perspectives

The technique of multiple perspectives involves showing a figure from different
perspectives, giving an eclectic image combining the most descriptive and
characteristic view of each part. This was common in early Egyptian paintings. A
more contemporary application of multiple perspectives includes cubist
paintings, such as ***Georges Braque (The Round Table)***.

### Isometric Projection

Traditional Asian artists employed Oriental space, where planes recede on the
diagonal, but the lines instead of converging, remain parallel. This allows us
to feel the illusion of depth, but at the same time affords a more direct
depiction of the elements in the composition. This concept is also used in
Engineering and Architecture as isometric drawings.

Example
- ***David Hockney (Self-Portrait with the Blue Guitar)*** uses isometric
  projections to show depth in his painting. Although this gives a refreshing
  look at depth, different from linear perspective, yet this approach is not very
  popular in contemporary works.

### Frame Restriction

In a close form composition, the focus of the viewer remains in the painting.
The emphasis is given to the elements within the frame only. The frame sort of
encloses each element in the artwork, and the interest of the viewer remains in
the feelings and emotions depicted by these items only.

On the contrary, open form paintings allow the emotions emanating from the
elements in the frame to leak out of the composition. The viewer becomes
persuaded to wonder about the connections the elements hold from the elements
not in the frame.

Closed form are formal, structured in appearance, while, open forms being not so
common gives a casual at the same time special, momentary feeling.

Examples of Close Frame
- ***Pablo Picasso (Harlequin)***

### Spatial Puzzle

In a spatial puzzle, the visual space is distorted so as to confuse the viewer
and adding some humour to the artwork. There is enough ambiguity in the space to
keep the viewer busy and interested in figuring out the intricacies of the
contortions in the visual space.

Examples
- ***David Hockney (Kerby)*** shows multiple elements in a composition, where an
  element seemingly far behind in the picture is interacting with a figure right
  in the foreground. The artwork contains many such distortions, which almost
  give the artwork a humorous vibe.

## Rhythm

Rythm allows the viewers to experience kinaesthetic empathy, which is when a
visual experience actually stimulates one of the senses of the viewer. The idea
of rhythm is related to both the (illusive) movement of the elements in a
composition and the consequential movement of the viewer's eyes.

Example
- ***Charles Burchfield (The Insect Chorus)*** brings about the feeling of
  summer in the viewer. The various elements of the painting seem to be
  vibrating, which fabricates a mental image of cicadas chirping on a hot
  summer afternoon.

### Visual Rhythm

Rhythm is a principle based on repetition.

Examples
- ***Gene Davis (Billy Bud)*** presents a series of vertical elements extending
  across the design, almost regular variations in light and dark providing a
  visual pattern of stress and pause, almost like the sound of a drum beating a
  rhythmic sequence.

Most often, we think of rhythm in the context of shapes and their arrangements.

Examples
- ***Piet Mondrian (Broadway Boogie-Woogie)*** expresses, in the most abstract
  visual terms, not only the feel of on and off pattern of Broadway's neon
  landscape, but also the rhythmic sounds of 1940's instrumental blues music.

### Alternating Rhythm

Alternating Rhythm is created when two motifs alternate consistently with one
another to produce a regular, and often predictable sequence. However, the
predictability does not necessarily have a boring effect as long as the
repetition is not blatant.

Examples
- ***Jackson Pollock (Blue Poles)*** has shown an alternating rhythm, where the
  alternating motifs are filled with busy, complicating patterns of dribbled,
  smeared paint.
- ***Jackob Lawrence (Train Buggy)***

### Progressive Rhythm

Progressive Rhythm is created when there seems to be a localized rhythm, however
this rhythm gradually changes in a regular manner. There is a sense of a
sequential pattern, and this is most often achieved with a progressive variation
of the size of a shape, through its colour, or even texture.

Examples
- ***Hundertwasser (The Big Road)*** establishes a progressive rhythm, where
  concentric circle emanate from a center, and not only the size of these
  circles grow, but they also gradually change in shape, thus creating a
  progressive rhythm, rather than a simple repetition.

### Poly-Rhythmic Structures

The most complex rhythmic structure we can ascribe to an artwork, or musical
piece for that matter, is a polyrhythmic structure. This overlay of perhaps
several rhythmic patterns produces a complex result, even if the parts are
simple

Examples
- ***Jean-Léon Gérôme (The Duel after the Masquerade)*** presents a
  juxtaposition of multiple rhythms, with a loud and strong, resounding beat for
  the foreground, contrasted by a light, soft and muted rhythm created by the
  hazy trees in the background.

## Line

In art, line is considered as tool which has both a width and a length. We
consider line to be a moving dot, with the ability to create dynamism in a
composition, rather than a static element.

A line can convey emotions such as joy, anxiety, calm, etc. An artist can
endorse the emotions in his artwork using the right type of lines.

### Line and Shape

Line is an artistic shorthand, as using lines, one can depict an object with
fewer number of strokes. In real life, there are no lines, but only objects
which are linear in feeling. However, line can be used to describe these same
objects by simply drawing it in the same shape as the object, only showing
contours.

Examples
- ***George Grosz, Friedrich Ebert (Life of a Socialist)*** shows two human
  figures and a few other elements by only using line shaped as the elements,
  This shows the power of line and implies that line is a self-sufficient tool.

Line can also define form more than as a mere outline, such as in showing
terrain or graduated differences. This form is known as *cross contour*.

### Types of Lines

In addition to actual lines used to contouring,

- **Implied Line**: An implied line is created when a series of points are lined
  such that the viewer's eyes unintentionally and automatically follow them as a
  line,
- **Psychic Line**: This occurs when although this is no real line, yet we
  interpret there to be a mental connection between the characters, which
  persuades us to believe the existence of a hypothetical line. For example,
  when each figure is looking at a particular object, then our eyes follow in
  the same direction, in the direction of the psychic line.

The purpose of such lines is, not much different than actual lines, to visually
unify and bind different characters in a composition.

Examples
- ***Pietro Perugino (The Crucifixion of the Virgin)*** shows implied and
  physchic lines at work. The eyes of the characters are at the same level,
  therefore creating an implied line, and each of the character is looking at
  the eyes of the virgin, creating psychic lines.

### Line Direction

The visual literacy in the viewer usually goads the viewers to interpret
horizontal lines as carriers of repose, vertical lines as sign of a standing
body, but with the potential for activity, whereas diagonal lines as indices of
motion, indicating gesticulation or literal movement.

The horizontal and vertical lines within a design are called stabilizers,
elements that reduce any feeling of movement.

Examples
- ***Nicholas Poussin (The Funeral of Phocion)*** makes use of mainly vertical
  and horizontal lines. This is considered to a classical work, a sign of
  static, serene and unchanging image.
- ***Henri Matiss (Decorative Figure on an Ornamental Ground)*** defies the
  tradition by showing serenity and calm in the foreground by using mainly
  horizontal and vertical lines, whereas makes the background dynamic by using
  many curves and diagonal lines.

### Contour and Gesture

Any composition with the main element being a line is called a drawing. There
are two types of drawings
- **Contour**: When line are used to form a shape and describe the accurately
  observed outlines of elements in a composition, the result is called a contour
  drawing. These can be as detailed as possible, or may even be spontaneous and
  more sketchy.
- **Gesture**: When lines are used to denote gesture and are not majorly
  concerned with defining boundaries for elements, we call such drawings as
  gesture drawings. Gesture drawings only remotely capture the nuances of the
  objects' forms, but more thoroughly captures the momentary aspects of the
  subjects.

### Line Quality

Different kinds of lines exist, heavy and bold lines done with brush and ink
with varying thickness, rapid scribbling lines down with a dry brush.

The linear technique one chooses can produce emotional or expressive qualities
in the final pattern. Solid and bold, quiet and flowing, delicate and dainty,
jagged and nervous, or countless other possibilities will influence the effect
on the viewer of the design or drawing.

### Line as Value

A single line can only show the shape of the object, however will fail to
delineate the volume of the object. By varying the number of lines and their
proximity in to create areas of gray, artists can achieve the latter as well,
using only lines.

Examples
- ***Durer (Adam and Eve)*** uses the technique of cross-hatching to include
  areas of gray, therefore adding more texture to the figures, and giving them,
  in a sense, some volume.

### Line in Paintings

A painter might deliberately add lines in a painting for contouring, as outlines
of forms. The use of line, though, may vary, such as use of heavy and bold
lines, as in a comic was employed by ***Roy Lichtenstein (Crying Girl)***
whereas a more subtle use of lines for showing texture and contrast was
employed by ***Sandro Botticelli (The Birth of Venus)***.

Some paintings can be categorized as linear despite the absence of any actual
lines. An example for this would be ***Jacques Louis David (The Death of
Socrates)*** who created clear contrasts using only paint, and the viewer can
clearly establish the forms of each figure, thereby creating the illusion of
contours.

Linear techniques can be even used in applying colours, such as demonstrated by
***Toulouse Laturec (Cafe)***, who actually drew with his brush. He created
contrast by use lines of different shades, moving in varying directions.
A similar but more dynamic use of this technique was employed by ***Van Gogh
(The Starry Night)*** who used more curvy and diagonal lines implying motion.

### Lost and Found Contour

In some paintings, the artists reveal only part of the elements using a sharp
contour, but then the edge disappears. This technique is known as lost-and-found
contour. The viewer fills in the rest of the image himself, using his visual
perception.

Although lost-and-found contour has lesser relative clarity, however it hits
home harder, as in natural scenarios, our mind knows what we are ought to be
seeing before we even start to examine the object in front of us. Therefore,
intermittent contour gives us more excitement and a sense of satisfaction,
despite the absence of closure.

This effect is also present in photography. With the right selection of light
and shadow, a photograph can express the same emotions as a lost-and-found
contour would in case of a painting.

## Balance

As humans, we tend to look for balance, and if we fail to find it, a vague
uneasiness or dissatisfaction results. In assessing visual balance, we always
assume a centre vertical axis as a fulcrum for the canvas, which functions as a
scale, and the elements of the composition objects on the scale. Our innate
search for balance is satisfied only when theses objects form an equilibrium on
the virtual scale.

### Imbalance

Balance makes a composition more calm and serene, and in absence of equilibrium,
we feel the need to rearrange the elements. However, an artist may deliberately
introduce imbalance in a picture, perhaps to create anxiety commensurate to the
motif presented in the composition.

Imbalance, in this sense, can be a useful tool that may intrigue viewers and
attracts their attention for exactly this unexpected quality.

Examples
- ***Paul Klee (Whimsical Tight Rope Walker)*** uses the technique of imbalance
  to induce anxiety within the viewers, a fraction of the same anxiety as one
  would feel watching a rope walker in reality.

### Symmetrical Balance

Symmetrical balance, in which both sides of the vertical fulcrum look exactly
alike is the simplest type of balance to create and to recognize. One side of
the axis acts as a mirror image to the other side. This is also called
*bilateral symmetry*, and is more common in architecture than in paintings.
Symmetry is yet another technique that unifies compositions.

Many religion paintings intended to be altarpieces employed symmetrical balance
so as to not interrupt the prevailing tenor of the architectural setting.

On one hand, symmetrical balance can emanate vibes of placidity, and a viewer
can understand the patterns easily, however, they can easily become moderate,
and even humdrum. Usually, symmetry If the individual design elements are busy
and complex, then symmetry helps moderate the effect of these complex items, and
therefore keeps the viewers interested in the artwork.

Perfect symmetry is often called formal balance, and are mostly present only in
architecture.

### Asymmetrical Balance

In this case, balance is achieved by dissimilar objects, having equal visual
weight or in other words, equal eye attraction. This brings about a more
informal feeling than symmetrical balance, while avoiding the problem of
monotony.

Examples
- ***Katsushika Hokusai (South Wind and Clearing Weather)*** uses asymmetrical
  balance in his painting, where the large mountain mass on the right is
  intricately balanced by the light cloud patter over a dark sky on the left,
  and the forest at the foot of the mountain acting as concomitant to the clouds
  to weight off the mountain.

#### Balance by Colour

A small area of bright colour can balance a much larger are of a duller, more
neutral colour. This is employed by a number of paintings, and one such example
is the painting by ***Gauguin (Two women on a Beach)***. The woman on the right
of the canvas is much larger in size, and there seems to imbalance with respect
to weight or value, however, the dull colour of the larger woman's dress is
perfectly balanced by the bright red colour on the left.

#### Balance by Value

Asymmetrical balance is based on equal eye attraction; dissimilar objects are
equally interesting to the eye. One element that attracts our attention is value
difference, a contrast of light and dark. Black against white gives a stronger
contrast than gray against white; therefore, a smaller amount of black is needed
to visually balance a larger amount of gray. This is precisely exemplified in
the painting by ***Jeremy Sutton (Moment in Time)***

#### Balance by Shape

A more neutral and temperate shaped object can be balanced by an intricate,
more dynamic shaped object of a much lesser size. This is seen in a modern day
DSLR camera, where the large simple shape of the lenses is balanced by the many
smaller intricate shapes around the lenses.

#### Balance by texture

A finer and more intricate texture can balance off a much larger planar surface.
For example, in the famous painting by Mary Cassatt, the plain figures on the
left are much larger in size, but are still balanced by the finer pattern shown
in the reflections from the silver tea set.

#### Balance by Position

A visual design does not betray the general laws defined by physics. A small
object put far away from the fulcrum can balance out a larger object kept closer
to the axis. In visual design, this means that a large object placed near the
center can be balanced by a smaller item placed out toward the edge.

Examples
- ***Edger Degas (Dancers Practicing at the Bar)*** puts emphasis on the small
  water can on the left using isolation, and the distance from the axis
  balanced the weight of the much larger dancers towards the center.

#### Balance by Eye Direction

A single small space can be as important as many larger ones if it is made the
focal point of the design.

Asymmetrical balance is based on equal eye attraction, and here the large
elements themselves make a small element the focal point. This also includes the
directions in which the characters of the design look, as we also tend to look
the same way.

Examples
- ***Georges Seurat (Le Chahut)*** employs balance by eye direction, throwing
  focus on small, seemingly unimportant gaslight. All the figures in the
  painting point towards this light, such as the man with points the cello
  toward the lamp, the other man is directly looking towards the lamp, and the
  dancers are extending their feet in the direction of this lamp, and parallel
  to the cello.

### Radial Balance

When all the elements seem to emanate out from a common central point, radial
balance is established. This is different from perfect symmetry, as the elements
emanating from the center need not be repetitions of the same element, however
their eye attraction would feel to be the same. This is exhibited naturally by a
snowflake.

One point perspective designs may also afford such balance, however this is in
general rare in narrative painting.

### Crystallographic Balance

When an artist puts equal emphasis over the whole design, that is tantamount eye
attraction almost everywhere, it is known as crystallographic balance, or
colloquially, *allover pattern*. This is a special refinement over symmetrical
balance.

A uniform pattern is present over the whole canvas, and there is no starting or
no end, and there is no-focal point, if the whole picture itself is not a focal
point. Even with a seemingly irregular pattern, such as graduated values (of
colour) over the pattern or subtle changes in the pattern (repetition with
variety), crystallographic balance can be achieved.

Examples
- ***Lee Krasner (White Squares)*** uses this technique, where small white
  squares filled with irregular patterns are spread over the canvas. There is no
  focal point and the eyes of the viewer simply float over the whole picture
  before falling out of the frame.

This technique is often employed in fabrics.
