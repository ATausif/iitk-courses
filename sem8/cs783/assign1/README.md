## Running the code

After downloading the data to the "data" folder (separately in train and test
folders), the program can be run as follows

> python main.py

The program is compatible with both python2 as well as python3. In order to turn
off the preprocessing of the SIFT features of the training images, the
*preprocess* flag needs to be set to False.

The code takes around 200s to run for 14 test images along with preprocessing of
train images which takes about 50s.
